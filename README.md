# #HangMe
I am a bad guy, and I am to die by hanging, however, the only way to successfully hang me is to guess the word in my head,one letter at a time, in a specified number of tries.
- For each letter you guesss wrong, you slowly lose your change to get justice.
- For each letter you guess correctly, you gradually move towards your objective of hanging me

Can you successfully #hangme?

## Difficulty level: Beginner
## Language: Python

At the end of this #CodeAlong session, you should have been able to learn the following
- [Basic Python syntax](/PythonBasics/_00_start.py)
- [Variables](/PythonBasics/_03_variables.py)
- [Iterables](/PythonBasics/_05_loops.py)
- [Functions](/PythonBasics/_09_functions.py)
- [Conditionals](/PythonBasics/_06_conditionals.py) and [Loops](/PythonBasics/_05_loops.py)
- [Modules](/PythonBasics/_07_modules.py)
- And some more advanced but simple-to-grab stuff

Ready to #CodeAlong? Let's begin! However, you need these tools to start
1. Git (You probably already have git, and a github account. If you don't, well, you can just hit "sign-up" now on the top right of this screen). Also download github by visiting https://git-scm.com/downloads and following the instructions
2. Python. I normally recommend the full package of Anaconda - a distribution that includes not only Python, but most likely everything you need to have as a Python Data Scientist. Get it here -> https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads
3. Visual Studio Code - Microsoft's Integrate Development Environment for all things software development. This, in my opinion, is by far the best IDE you can use for any language. Get it here -> https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Once you have satisfied these requirements, you can start by:

1. Fork this git
2. Clone the fork on your PC
3. Join the live session, let us #CodeAlong

If you already have hands-on experience and want to dive into the projects in the code, go straight to the [project video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0WpwgDTP6M&list=PLHVDW0y9HAIpA2IW-gplHFp_EHmQ7sEVZ&index=6&t=0s) and the [code repo](https://github.com/kcemenike/hangme/tree/master/game_files)   

To run the completed project, navigate to the game_files folder, then run  
`python main.py`
